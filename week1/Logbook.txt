 Problem: Inchworm.lunchtime(branch, rest, leaf)

First idea:
  Loop i from 0 to branch step=rest; if (i % leaf == 0) res++

Why it might work:
  We simulate each landing and check leaf alignment.

Try #1 (brute force):
  Code:
    for (int i = 0; i <= branch; i += rest)
      if (i % leaf == 0) ++res;
  Result: Works on small tests. Complexity ~ O(branch/rest). Could be slow for big branch when rest is small.

- Reflection:
    First try
