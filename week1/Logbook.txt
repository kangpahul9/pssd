 Problem: Inchworm.lunchtime(branch, rest, leaf)

First idea:
  Loop i from 0 to branch step=rest; if (i % leaf == 0) res++

Why it might work:
  We simulate each landing and check leaf alignment.

Try #1 (brute force):
  Code:
    for (int i = 0; i <= branch; i += rest)
      if (i % leaf == 0) ++res;
  Result: Works on small tests. Complexity ~ O(branch/rest). Could be slow for big branch when rest is small.

Try #2 (gcd)
    x = Greatest Common divisor of leaf and rest to find the point at which they meet interval 
    dividing the branch by x to find out many time that interval exists between the branch

Try #3 (lcm)
    mistook gcd as lcm earlier 
- Reflection:
    Was a good question but got through it using simple maths topic


Problem: ThrowTheBall 
First Idea:
Simulate it in N*M Loop
Why it might work:
We storing count for every person in vector

Try #1(Brute Force)
    Code: 
     while (p[i] < M)
        p[i]++;
        if(p[i] % 2 == 0)
            i =  (i + L) % N;
        else
            i = (i - L + N) % N;
    count++;

    #2 submission did p[0]++; and moved p[i]++ to end of loop 

- Reflection:
    did not find any better way to do it


Problem: PartySeats
First Idea:
Splitting into two different vectors for both the genders and sorting them then inserting one alternate ones and also saw that number of girls and boys need to be greater than 2 each
Why it might work:
It might work as we covered all edgecases

Reflection
I was returning vector earlier now i'm returning string 
Now changing function to vector string 
Now i've changed how to get name and string
